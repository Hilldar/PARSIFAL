# Future upgrades
Up to now the setting of the triple-GEMs are introduced by the variable setup (=0)
This determines the following variables:
- collection efficiency x 3
- extraction efficiency x 3
- GEM gain x 3
These variables depends on the gain of the detector
-> It is missing the check on the gain file

The ionization depends on the particle, now only muons are considered
This determines the following variables:
- number of primary electron cluster
- number of secondary electron for each primary cluster
These variables depends on the particle type, kinetic energy and the gas mixture
