Requirements: a working installation of ROOT (root.cern.ch). Tested on ROOT version 6.12/04

HOWTO:
1) set the ROOT environment variables: source $ROOTSYS/bin/thisroot.sh
2) go to the directory where you copied PARSIFAL
3) initilize PARSIFAL with the command: source init_PARSIFAL.sh
4) set the PARSIFAL environment variables: source $PARSIFAL/bash_PARSIFAL2
5) get the PARSIFAL command list: parsifal -h
6) compile the code: parsifal -m

EXAMPLE
Run the command: parsifal -S 1 0
It runs the configuration 1 contained in run_list.txt and generates muon tracks with incident angle 0 degrees with respect to the direction orthogonal to the detector plane
In run_list.txt, configuration 1 is:
1 13.0 1.2 1.0
which are respectively the run number, the tuning factor on the gain, the tuning factor on the spatial diffusion, the tuning factor on the temporal diffusion.



# Future upgrades
Up to now, the settings of the triple-GEM are introduced by the variable setup (=0)
This determines the following variables:
- collection efficiency x 3
- extraction efficiency x 3
- GEM gain x 3
These variables depend on the gain of the detector
-> the check on the gain file is missing

The ionization depends on the particle, now only muons are considered
This determines the following variables:
- number of primary clusters of electrons
- number of secondary electrons for each primary cluster
These variables depend on the particle type, its kinetic energy and the gas mixture
