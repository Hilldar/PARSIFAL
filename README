# Future upgrades
Up to now, the settings of the triple-GEM are introduced by the variable setup (=0)
This determines the following variables:
- collection efficiency x 3
- extraction efficiency x 3
- GEM gain x 3
These variables depend on the gain of the detector
-> the check on the gain file is missing

The ionization depends on the particle, now only muons are considered
This determines the following variables:
- number of primary clusters of electrons
- number of secondary electrons for each primary cluster
These variables depend on the particle type, its kinetic energy and the gas mixture
